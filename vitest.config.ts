			// all four metrics drop out and a directory can print a middling percentage
			// with its finished files nowhere in the listing. Setting `coverage.skipFull`
			// back to false does not undo it, because the override is applied to the
			// reporter's own options, which win. From a plain terminal, and on CI, none of
			// that applies and every file is listed. The html report always has all of
			// them, so open that before concluding something is uncovered.

			// detail it puts in the pull request comment.
