/**
 * A registered tool, with its parameter type deliberately erased.
 *
 * Tools have differing parameter shapes but have to share one array, so the shape cannot
 * survive into this interface. `toolFactory` is what keeps the guarantee: it checks each
 * handler against its own schema before widening it to fit here.
 *
 * `C` is the client the handlers drive, and it is a parameter rather than a concrete type
 * because the registry itself never calls into the client — it only binds it. Each app names
 * its client once, where it binds `toolFactory`, and exports a bound alias for its tool
 * arrays to annotate with: the handler's `client` parameter is contravariant, so a bare
 * `ToolDefinition` naming no client could not accept handlers typed against a real one.
 *
 * `level` is the tool's declared reach — see `tool-ceilings.ts` for the vocabulary — and it is
 * required rather than defaulted, because a default is either fail-open or a silent withhold.
 * Whether a client is offered the tool is decided at registration, from this declaration and
 * the deployment's ceiling for the group, never from the tool's name.
 *
 * `successMessage` is how a write tool gets its worded confirmation without building a response
 * of its own — see `withErrorHandling` for why that matters.
