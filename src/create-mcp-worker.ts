/**

 *
 * Two invariants live in here so that no consumer can reconstruct them wrongly, because both
 * fail silently under local testing and loudly under load:
 *
 * - The `McpServer` and the client are rebuilt for every request, inside the handler where
 *   nobody can hoist them. A shared instance answers sequential requests perfectly correctly;
 *   it comes apart only under concurrency, because closing the server at the end of one
 *   exchange aborts every handler still in flight on it and those requests never settle.
 *
 * - The withheld-tools announcement runs once per isolate, from inside `fetch`, because the
 *   ceilings come from `env` and module scope never sees `env` on Workers. The factory is
 *   called once at the consumer's module scope, so this closure's lifetime is the isolate's.
 *   Two first requests racing can double-log; that is benign and not worth a lock.
