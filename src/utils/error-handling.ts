			// text, and using it as the text breaks the promise this response's own type makes.
			// A tool with nothing to report and nothing to say gets empty text, which is the honest
			// answer — a tool that wants to say something returns a string and leaves through the
			// branch above.
			// Annotated because `lib.d.ts` types `JSON.stringify` as returning a `string`, which
			// makes the check below look like dead code to anyone reading the types rather than
			// this comment. The overload telling the truth is the one taking a value that may not
			// be representable, and this is that case.
			// No indent argument, and that is a decision rather than an omission. The reader on
			// the other end of this text is a model, so two spaces a level buys legibility for
			// nobody and spends context on whitespace — a listing of a hundred nested tickets
			// pays for it many times over. Do not put `null, 2` back to make a response easier to
			// eyeball while debugging; read it through `jq` at the point you are debugging, and
			// leave what ships compact.
