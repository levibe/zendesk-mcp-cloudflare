/**
 * Creates a tool definition, deriving the handler's parameters from the schema.
 *
 * `level` is the tool's declared reach, and declaring it is a deliberate act of
 * classification — see `tool-ceilings.ts` for the vocabulary and `ToolDefinition` for why
 * there is no default. The type only admits the declarable subset, so `activate` is not a
 * value a tool can even attempt.
 *
 * The handler never restates its parameter type — it is inferred from `schema`, so the two
 * cannot drift apart. Adding a field to a shared schema immediately makes that field visible
 * to every handler spreading it, and naming a field the schema does not declare is now an
 * error rather than a parameter the server will never populate.
 *
 * The cast is the one place the specific parameter type is given up, and it is safe precisely
 * here: the compiler has just checked `handler` against `schema` for this call, and the MCP
 * server validates incoming arguments against that same schema before the handler ever runs.
 *
 * `successMessage` heads the record a write hands back — `'Ticket created successfully!'` above
 * the created ticket — and is applied on the success path only, so it cannot dress a failure up
 * as a success. A handler wording its whole answer, as `delete_ticket` does with an empty body
 * to report, returns the sentence as a string and leaves this unset: `withErrorHandling` passes
 * a string through untouched and never consults the message.
