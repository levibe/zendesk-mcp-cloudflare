/**
 * Registration is the only thing standing between a write tool and a client, so what it
 * publishes is a security boundary rather than a detail of how tools are wired together.
 * A tool that is defined but never registered cannot be called; one that slips through can.
 *
 * Everything here is pure registry behavior, driven through a stub client — the registry
 * never calls into the client, it only binds it. The tests that hold this repo's shipped
 * surface still — the pinned inventory, and the announcement over the real manifest — live
 * in `src/tool-ceilings-config.test.ts`, because they are coupled to wrangler.jsonc and
 * `toolCategories` rather than to the registry.
